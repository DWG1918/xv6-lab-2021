2.There is none. g(x) is inlined within f(x) and f(x) is further inlined into main()
3.ra = 0x30, jalr 1528(ra) # 0x628, so address that function printf located is 0x628.
4.0x38, the address of the next instruction of jalr.
5.Output is "HE110 World", Hex of 57616 is "e110", and 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64 is the ASCII of r, l, d, if big-endian, reverse to 0x726c6400, no need to change 57616.
6.A random value depending on what codes there are right before the call.Because printf tried to read more arguments than supplied.The second argument `3` is passed in a1, and the register for the third argument, a2, is not set to any specific value before the call, and contains whatever there is before the call.
